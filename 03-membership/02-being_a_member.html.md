title: Being a Member
```

- {Write here what members are expected to do} :

   1. participate : be active in the discussions, participate regularly to events and retreats, bring content to others, help the others
   2. help to organize things for Mangrove. It's ok to say no when a coordinator contacts you for help when it's not a good time for you, but if you're never available to help, it can be an issue (see Membership Issues)
   3. be proactive : start initiatives that will delight the other members ! 

###A word about mutual help

**Helping fellow members** is the best thing you can do inside Mangrove: you’ll help them grow, and you’ll grow at the same time by helping. It also fosters the birth of successful personal projects.

Here are a few **ideas** of how to help fellow members:

- use your skills to make someone’s personal project better
- teach someone something cool
- lend your flat or your couch to someone moving to your city
- share opportunities (gigs & jobs, conference talks, event invitations)
- connect members with people they should meet

You’ll get **updates on challenges people are currently facing** every week on Slack, so you can easily jump in if you can be of any help.

When someone helps you, don’t forget to **share how thankful you are** (on Slack for example).
