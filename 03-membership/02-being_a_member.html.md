title: Being a Member
```

- {Write here what members are expected to do} :

   1. participate : be active in the discussions, participate regularly to events and retreats, bring content to others, help the others
   2. help to organize things for Mangrove. It's ok to say no when a coordinator contacts you for help when it's not a good time for you, but if you're never available to help, it can be an issue (see Membership Issues)
   3. be proactive : start initiatives that will delight the other members !
