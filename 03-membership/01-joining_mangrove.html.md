title: Joining Mangrove
```

{inspiration : adrien's text on slack : *At the end of the retreat, if the Mangrove members who attended the retreat agree unanimously that this person should join Mangrove, this person becomes a member.*
*The first 6 months of membership are a "certainty period" to make sure that this person takes actively part in Mangrove's life (organizing events, retreats, and participating in our discussions!). At the end of these 6 months, the residents have to agree unanimously that this person is a great fit with Mangrove and this person then becomes a definitive member.*}

- People who are interested by joining the community first apply to a retreat.
- Applicants to a retreat are selected according to how we perceive their mindset and their values. The mindset we are looking for is described in the "Who are Mangrove Members" section {<- put the link}
- After the retreat, if the applicant is still interested to join the community, and if all the Mangrove Members who were present at the retreat think there has a good fit with the community, he or she immediately becomes a member. The 3 main validation criteria are:

  1. Confirmation of the values and personal qualities expected for every member
  2. Good fit with the group
  3. Will and ability to get actively engaged in the community.
  
- The first six month, the new member is in Certainty Period. The role of this period is to make sure that he/she finds its place in Mangrove and really participates. *Two former members ensure the onboarding of the new member and are available to answer all her/his questions.* **(<- decide if we keep this or not)**
- During this period, he/she has to organize one online or hub event, and to take part to a Retreat Squad.
- At the end of the Certainty Period, the Residents validate the membership and he/she becomes a member for good. If unfortunately, the person did not participate as described in "Being a Member", the membership will end there.
