title: Joining Mangrove
```

- People who are interested by joining the community first apply to a retreat.
- Applicants to a retreat are selected according to how we perceive their mindset and their values. The mindset we are looking for is described in the "Who are Mangrove Members" section {<- put the link}
- After the retreat, if the applicant is still interested to join the community, and if all the Mangrove Members who were present at the retreat think there has a good fit with the community, he or she immediately becomes a member. The 3 main validation criteria are:

  1. Confirmation of the values and personal qualities expected for every member
  2. Good fit with the group
  3. Will and ability to get actively engaged in the community.
  
- The first six month, the new member is in Certainty Period. The role of this period is to make sure that he/she finds its place in Mangrove and really participates.
- During this period, he/she has to organize one online or hub event, and to take part to a Retreat Squad.
- At the end of the Certainty Period, the Residents validate the membership and he/she becomes a member for good. If unfortunately, the person did not participate as described in "Being a Member", the membership will end there.
