```
title: End of Membership
```

We highly value regular interactions and participation. Mangrove is like a family: you don’t turn your membership on and off every week.

When a member isn’t able to participate anymore, they should share an update on Slack. They will simply leave the community and its tools. If they want to come back, they should reach out to Residents and their coming back will be discussed case by case.

If the member becomes inactive during the first 3 months of their membership, they will have to start again their Certainty Period from the beginning if they come back.

Problems with a member’s behavior can also lead to the end of membership. It’s discussed case by case within the Residents (see [Membership Issues](/membership/membership-issues) in Important Agreements).
