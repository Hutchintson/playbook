### The personal qualities that we look for :

Mangrove values the following personal qualities of its members:

- **openness and curiosity**: Mangrove wouldn’t exist if its first members weren’t interested in different lifestyle, and open to listen to new and uncommon ideas. 
- **sense of collectiveness**: our community values cooperation over competition, sharing over hiding, collective achievement over standing out individually.
- **thoughtfulness**: in-depth thinking and the capacity of seeing further than the evidences are important qualities for us.
- **franchise, clarity and relational maturity**: members should nourish a virtuous circle of clear and constructive interactions with the group. They should use non violent communication and look for solutions instead of showing their anger when a problem appears.
- **empathy and listening**: putting yourself in others' shoes is key to understand others' feelings and point of views. Good listeners often are the most helpful people.
- **positive mindset and energy**: optimism, enthusiasm and positive energy are the source of Mangrove's momentum. 
- **ambition and humility**: Mangrove members are all changemakers in their own way. The ambition of seeing one’s dreams come true shouldn’t come with an uncontrolled ego. We see humility as a key quality for personal growth and interesting interactions.
- **significant experience in one field**: in order to bring value to the community, every member should have good skills in a field (not necessarily technology!).

Apart from these personality traits, we highly care about diversity in terms of genders, nationalities, skills and social backgrounds. The Mangrove community thrives on such diversity of individual personalities and talents that are able to unfold within it. We see differences as a source of stimulation and creativity.
