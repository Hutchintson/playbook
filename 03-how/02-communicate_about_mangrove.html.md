### Pitching Mangrove

**Type the command** `mangrovepitch` in slack to get access to the latest **wording**, and **pitch videos**.

#### Who are you pitching?

* Potential builders and friends who are in the startup world?
* Interested people who are not in this world?
* Managers of big corporations interested in the way we work?
* A wide and/or unknown audience?

Depending on the answer, **the words you use** and the **facts & ideas you highlight** should change to suit your audience.

Here are a few tips for a better pitch:

1. **Show that you know your audience:**

   1. Use **their** words.

      If you are talking to a fellow startuper, you will use the words "slack", "bot", "members".

      > eg: For corporate people, our nomad education is close to a 'seminar'. Slack is the equivalent of their 'internal social network'. Their closest experience to a 'member' is a 'colleague', and the 'organisation' is the 'company'. A 'bot' can be called a 'robot' for someone who never heard of bots.

   2. Connect to **their** wants and desires.

      > eg: the flexibility we offer provides different advantages for different people.

      > To a young graduate, talk about how it allows them to discover the world and maintain personal projects while working.
      > To a young parent, talk about how it helps them choose their working hours and be more present at important times for their family and children.

      > eg: corporate people often don't directly relate to the desire for 'personal fulfillment', but they may see 'human resources' as critical. And both can be easily connected.

   3. Use **examples** they can **relate to** by modifying your examples to meet their needs.

2. Show that you **already know how they perceive you**.

   > eg: If you are talking for people of all ages and all backgrounds, they will see us as "young people from the startup world". So, talk about us in your intro as "a team of young startupers". If you are talking to young graduates, don't say we're "young" since they don't see us like that. They just see us as "startupers".

3. When there are **two sides** of a same thing, always present the side that speaks to them.

   > eg: the pairing process can lead to personal or professional talks. Corporate people are focused on business efficiency: show that it can help someone stuck in a project to get out of isolation. But if you talk to someone focused on personal development, talk about how feedback helps them grow.

   > eg: you can present our openness in terms of the ideal: that we deeply believe that more openness is necessary for a more fulfilling society, and how it connects to our values. But to someone else only interested in mechanisms, you can present it under the light of one of its effects, as a powerful tool of inbound marketing.

1. Try to **conclude** on a **takeaways** that can be useful for them in particular.

1. **Learn** from the **reactions** after your pitch. In your next presentations, you should directly answer the first questions or remarks that come up.

   > eg: the question of the possibility to go to the retreats when one has a family life often comes up. Incorporate in your deck a picture of a father with his child in a retreat, and your audience won't be busy thinking about this question anymore. This way, your pitch will become more effective each time.

### Handling our social media accounts

Each month, two community leaders are appointed by the Mangrove Builders on Slack.
The first one is responsible for maintaining our social media activity with a fluid publication calendar. The second one has to manage and answer the Mangrove emails.

Community leaders are also responsible for keeping a consistent editorial line. They must be proactive and create most of the content while carrying out their duties.

That being said, each builder may create content for the Mangrove social media accounts. All posts must serve the interest of the Mangrove community. In other words, there should be no personal projects unless they follow the Mangrove vision. As a Mangrove Builder, if you want to publish content, you must refer to the current community lead. They are the only one who can decide the publication timing, and give you the final approval.

Besides, feel free to use our mailing list by using Mailchimp. Follow the previous templates. If you need the password, contact the community lead by private message on Slack.
