### Guest (3 months max)

The goal is to see if this new person fits well with the community and wants to take part in Mangrove’s life as a member in the long term.

The Guest period lasts 3 months during which we encourage the potential member to discover the ecosystem, participate in its daily life (online and offline) and hopefully benefit from it as much as possible.

They have access to all Mangrove events and retreats, Mangrove offices, Slack channels for Guests as well as our online collaboration tools (mood bot, P2P learning, fresh manatee…)

Retreats are one of the most exciting things happening within Mangrove. They are a great place to meet other members, exchange ideas, get inspired and understand what this project really is about. As a Guest, the only requirement to become a member is to attend a retreat during this 3-month period (for at least 3 days and maximum 7 days). 

After the retreat or at the end of the 3 months, the Guest can express their interest in joining Mangrove as a member to the Greeters. The first step for the latter is to get the Guest’s approval of the Playbook and answer their questions. Once it’s done, the Greeters will submit a vote within the Residents: there should be at least 5 YESs as well as 0 NO during the 7 days following the voting submission in order to integrate this Guest as an official member.

Greeters can also decide to stop the Guest period at any moment if they believe it’s not a good fit in order not to lose anyone’s time.

The 3 main validation criteria are:

1. Confirmation of the values and personal qualities expected for every member
2. Good fit with the group
3. Will and ability to get actively engaged in a track as a Builder during the next 6 month


### Builder (6 months)

New members start their membership as Builders: over 6 months, they will be part of one Track and actively contribute to its development. A Track is like a small team working towards the same goal. It’s a good way to collaborate with other members and participate in the development of our community at the same time.

Within Mangrove, we value members’ output rather than their input. What matters is that a Builder actively helps their Track, but they are free regarding the way they do so as long as it’s aligned with the goal and coordinated with the rest of the team.

Builders should share their contribution through the #done channel in order to maximize transparency and collaboration within the community. If no contribution to the Track is recorded over several weeks in a row, the coordinator should reach out and try to help the new member on their engagement: understanding what doesn’t work, switching of project or even of Track if needed.

After 6 months of activity as a Builder, the member becomes a Resident.


### Resident (for life)

Residents are part of Mangrove as long as they stay active within the community. Within Mangrove, activity is mainly recorded through /done and /thanks.

Their engagement is more flexible: they can join up to 2 Tracks but don’t have to be part of a Track anymore if they don’t want to.

They are also responsible for having a voice in the recruitment, managing legal & finance topics and participating in strategic discussions related to the future of Mangrove (especially during the Mangrove Summit every 6 months).
