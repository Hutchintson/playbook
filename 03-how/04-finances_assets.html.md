### Physical Assets

While all assets belong to Mangrove, a builder can access the asset for a period of time, determined depending on context. Having access to an asset means that you have to take care of it [link to shepherding], in exchange for its use.

When a member leaves Mangrove, they must return all assets. They do that by delegating the responsibilities they have over the physical assets to other members. They must seek advice from people directly affected by this transition as well.

A member cannot use Mangrove's physical assets for personal use, as it doesnâ€™t help the purpose of Mangrove. However, they can ask affected members to buy or lease the asset with associated guarantees.

> eg. Mangrove needed a Drone to make a promotional video for a retreat. After making comparisons and presenting the results to the rest of the team, one of the members bought a drone with his own money and was paid back a few weeks after.

### Money Management

All profits generated within Mangrove are re-invested in other Mangrove projects.

When money is needed for a project, the people in charge of the project can simply ask in the #finance channel for the required amount. This starts a discussion about the potential investment with the rest of the team [see buying something for Mangrove].

A treasurer is elected every 3 months and is held responsible for the financials. They have to regularly check the #finance channel in order to register cashflow. They can use their favorite accounting system (we like Google Spreadsheets, Lydia and Tricount). 

Every two weeks, they must publicly communicate the following:

* the balance
* the debts of Mangrove towards its members
* the distribution of refunds
