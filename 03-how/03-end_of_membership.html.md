title: End of Membership
```

We highly value regular interactions and contributions. Mangrove is like a family: you don’t turn your membership on and off every week. Everyone should then be active on a weekly basis except during time off. Activity is mainly tracked with /done and /thanks.

When a member isn’t able to participate anymore, they should share an update on Slack. They will simply leave the community and its tools. If they want to come back, they should reach out to active Residents and their coming back will be discussed case by case.

If the member becomes inactive during the first 3 months of their membership, they will have to start the Builder stage again if they come back. If it happens during the second half of the Builder period, they will resume where they had stopped.

Problems with a member’s behavior can also lead to the end of membership. It’s discussed case by case within the Residents (see Membership issues in Important Agreements).
