### What am I supposed to do in Mangrove ?

The only thing you’re **supposed** to do is to contribute, in a way that brings value to Mangrove. When it comes down to what to do precisely, only you can choose it - the other members can only help you find it.

* Look at the ongoing projects and efforts, pick the one you like the most, and propose ways you can help. Other builders already on the project will welcome your energy if you offer it! There are so many issues to tackle!

* If you spot something that could bring value to Mangrove, check with others that it actually brings value, and do it. Or even, don’t check if you want and just do it, but then your contribution points / recognition in Mangrove linked to what you did might be subject to discussion. The only rule: if what you do impacts the work of others, talk to them before working on it. Just put in the effort and be creative about what could help the Mangrove lifestyle expand. \(\*\)

* There are also some day-to-day tasks to be done, but most of them require to have spent some time in Mangrove \(pitches, answering emails..\) : new members mostly contribute through projects.

The steps to achieve our vision are only ‘loosely’ planned, on purpose. We create a framework of emergence : in which the projects and next realisations emerge from the motivations of the members and the expressed needs from the ecosystem. What Mangrove will be in one year will emerge from all the energy we have inside, and how our frameworks combine this energies towards common projects that matter. To make the ecosystem grow in one direction - whatever this direction is, whether it has been planned or not - some focus is needed. That is why we focus on this idea of "common projects that matter". The most important matters in the ecosystem will be voted on by the members. Members taking part in the 2-weeks sprint teams to resolve them will be particularly rewarded.

_\(\*\) precision : we introduced a notion of rights \(with the 'tracks'\) to keep this freedom while taking more newcomers without endangering the integrity of the organisation : you cannot from the very beginning have the right to change the website only by yourself or integrate a new member. But you can help building peer to peer learning processes, work on co-living or co-working projects, work on the project helping people to switch to freelancing.._

### Why does Mangrove sometimes feel like a collection of individual projects which align with the philosophy?

For the moment it might _feel_ like that indeed, but it isn’t in reality. To achieve the goal of Mangrove - creating and promoting a new work lifestyle, and creating the tools/frameworks/environment for that - a lot of different aspects of this lifestyle must be developed. This is why the granularity for each project is, for the moment, almost reduced to one person - but with growth, we will start having teams involved instead of individuals, and this trend is going to become stronger and stronger.
