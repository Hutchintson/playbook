### Responsibility

Having members taking clearly defined responsibilities and assuming them is key for Mangrove. It is the condition for a flat organization to work, and goes hand in hand with the freedom of action. There are two ways of taking responsibility within Mangrove:

1. **public responsibility**: In this option, the responsibility is publicly documented, including the deadlines or the expected outcomes \(currently in Trello\). The member is accountable to Mangrove in general for this, and to no one in particular. Therefore, no one should act as a manager or pressure them about it. It is his/her duty to communicate actively and regularly about the updates concerning their responsibility, and to particularly do it towards the others members who are impacted by their activity.
1. **private responsibility**: Often, someone who bears an important responsibility like organizing a retreat cannot do the work alone and needs the help of others. This help can sometimes be too small to be subject to a formal public responsibility, like just sending an important email. In this case, the helper takes a private responsibility towards the member having the public responsibility.

In both cases, the members should not be judged on the way they accomplish their works, but only on the promised outcomes.

### Projects in Mangrove

Projects are not subject to formalism and rules like responsibilities are. Responsibilities management is the only cornerstone of Mangrove’s activity. “Project” is just a handy word to talk about a main activity that is being conducted at the moment.

A project can be handled and managed in many different ways, and include several or many members. Some examples are :

* having an identified leader responsible for its advancement, which ensures that it will be conducted to the end. This management mode is necessary when the project is really mandatory for Mangrove, or when commitments have to be taken, like when organizing a monthly meeting or a retreat.
* being something that members talk about and work on, without clear management, like working on a new bot. In this case, the outcome is not guaranteed, and will be the result of the energy and will of the members. This management mode is a very good way for Mangrove to listen to its inner self, instead of working on actions planned according to a strategy.

### Mangrove Contribution Points

Contributing to Mangrove gives the right to accumulate Mangrove Contribution Points \(CP\). These points are not legal ownership rights like shareholder's actions, but give you weight in Mangrove's inner workings \(recognition, decision power & perks\).
At the end of every week, every member should record their contribution and attribute themselves points for that. These points are shared on Slack and are public on our website.

Every month, 3 members are picked randomly to check that the recorded contribution is aligned with the actual contribution and that everyone gave themselves the right amount of points. This group can encourage members to revise their recorded contribution, in order to add or remove points. They share a report publicly after this process so the community can know which updates happened. The goal is to identify patterns to make the process smoother and simpler.

The minimum monthly contribution is 15 CP \(except if time-off\). If a member doesn't reach this threshold, the 3 members who were picked randomly to check the contribution points this month have to discuss the situation with this member and make sure it doesn't happen again. Each time a member doesn't reach the 15 CP, this group also have to share the information to the rest of the community which can lead to other decisions regarding the member's involvement as a Mangrove Member.
