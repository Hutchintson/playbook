title: Conflict Resolution
```

Conflicts happen. It's ok.

**Step 1**

- Talk to the person with whom you have a conflict. Please take the time to really try to understand them, and to express yourself in a constructive way. The fours steps of Nonviolents Communication can inspire you :
    When I see that.......... (***Observation*** *on which you both agree*)
    I feel .......... (*your* ***Feelings***)
    because my need for .......... is/is not met. (*your* ***Needs***)
    Would you be willing to ..........? (*your* ***Request***)

**Step 2**

- If it doesn't work, choose a third person as a facilitator. This person will help you to sort things out.

**Step 3**

- If it doesn't work, ask advice around you to determine if a [Membership Issue](/important-agreements/membership-issues) is at stake. If it is the case, you can start related actions. If not, you and the other members helping you will need to get creative about this conflict.
