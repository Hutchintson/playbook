title: Money Management
```

Mangrove is a non-profit organization. Until now, it has mainly worked without money being involved, through members’ contributions and partnerships. The main goal of Mangrove is not to make money, and members don’t gain anything financially from participating to Mangrove.

For Mangrove activities that do involve money, its management must be done transparently.

In the long term, Mangrove hubs must sustain themselves financially.
