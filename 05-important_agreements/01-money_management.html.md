title: Money Management
```

Mangrove is a non-profit organization. Until now, it has mainly worked without money being involved, through partnerships and members’ contributions. The main goal of Mangrove is not to make money, and members don’t gain anything financially from participating in Mangrove.

For Mangrove activities that do involve money, its management must be done transparently.

In the long term, all Mangrove hubs will have to sustain themselves financially.
