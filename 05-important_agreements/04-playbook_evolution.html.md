```
title: Playbook Evolution
```

Changes to the playbook must reflect a collective agreement that the residents have reached, online or during a collective intelligence work as done during a Summit.

Changes can be made by any Resident ; all residents must be explicitely and quickly informed about it.

If any resident has a veto on the changes, the playbook is rolled back to the previous version, with which everyone agreed.
