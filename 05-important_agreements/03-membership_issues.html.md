### Lack of engagement

If a member is disengaged from the community (not answering messages, not doing anything for mangrove, not following any discussion for a long time), he/she has to become an inactive member. This means, among other things, being removed from Mangrove’s day-to-day tools. 

The person can come back an any time if he/she’s sure to be engaged again.

If someone reguarly comes back but stays inactive when coming back, it become a problem related to behavior and can lead to a more definitive exclusion.


### Problem related to behavior

If there is a true collaboration issue with a member because of some behaviors, mainly behaviors that are not respecting Mangrove’s values and causing real trouble to the community (other than lack of engagement), steps can be taken to try to solve this issue or, if needed, to exclude the member.

If you tried to resolve the conflict (see [Conflict Resolution](/important_agreements/conflict_resolution)) but it didn’t work, and if 3 Residents (you included if you are one) agree on the problem, they need to talk to this member and share publicly that this talk happened. 45 days later, if 3 Residents (not necessarily the same ones) are still unsatisfied about this member’s behavior, they should share the information among the Residents and ask for a Resident’s vote: “Should this member still be a Mangrove member?". After 5 days of voting, if more than 50% of the voters agree that the member should leave the community, he/she has to leave the group.

If you feel there is a problem related to a member's engagement in the community (lack of work dedicated to Mangrove, mindset issues, etc.), the first thing to do is to go and talk about it with this member. If this doesn't solve the problem, you should talk about it with other members. If 3 members agree on a lack of engagement from a Mangrove member, they need to talk to this member and share publicly that this talk happened. 45 days later, if 3 members (not necessarily the same ones) are still unsatisfied about this member’s engagement, they should share the information publicly and ask for a vote: “Should this member still be a Mangrove member?". After 5 days of voting, if more than 30% of the voters agree that the member should become a Mangrove friend, the member becomes a Mangrove friend (= no more responsibilities within Mangrove) or can leave the community.
