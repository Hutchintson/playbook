title: Playbook Evolution
```

**WRITING IN PROGRESS**

- change to the playbook must reflect a collective agreement that the residents have reached, on Slack or during a collective intelligence work as done during a Summit
- changes can be made by any Resident ; all residents must be explicitely informed about it.
- If any resident has a veto on the changes, the playbook is rolled back to the previous version, with which everyone agreed.
