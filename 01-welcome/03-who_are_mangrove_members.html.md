title: Who are Mangrove members
```

### Mangrove members are people who share Mangrove's values, and a common mindset made of:

- **openness and curiosity**: Mangrove wouldn’t exist if its first members weren’t interested in different lifestyle, and open to listen to new and uncommon ideas. 
- **sense of collectiveness**: our community values cooperation over competition, sharing over hiding, collective achievement over standing out individually.
- **thoughtfulness**: in-depth thinking and the capacity of seeing further than the evidences are important qualities for us.
- **franchise, clarity and relational maturity**: members should nourish a virtuous circle of clear and constructive interactions with the group. They should use non violent communication and look for solutions instead of showing their anger when a problem appears.
- **empathy and listening**: putting yourself in others' shoes is key to understand others' feelings and point of views. Good listeners often are the most helpful people.
- **positive mindset and energy**: optimism, enthusiasm and positive energy are the source of Mangrove's momentum. 
- **ambition and humility**: Mangrove members are all changemakers in their own way. The ambition of seeing one’s dreams come true shouldn’t come with an uncontrolled ego. We see humility as a key quality for personal growth and interesting interactions.
- **significant experience in one field**: in order to bring value to the community, every member should have good skills in a field (not necessarily technology!).
