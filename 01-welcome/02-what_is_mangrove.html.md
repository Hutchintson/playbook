title: What is Mangrove
```

**We are a community of creators who share the same values and gather around retreats.**

Doing so, **we grow together.** We **help each** other and **build a new lifestyle** closer to our shared ideal. We also put efforts into **constantly expanding** to other like-minded people.

We are gathered around three values : **freedom**, **benevolence** and **openness**.

- **freedom**: We believe that great things happen when people go out of the normal path to pursue their own.
- **benevolence**: We want to do good. We believe that help is valuable to both the receiver and the giver, hence making us all happier.
- **openness**: We value diversity. We want to meet inspiring people, and keep an open-minded attitude towards what we don't know.

Mangrove is not owned by anyone and is not led by an identified leader. It is organic and **inspired from new kinds of organizations**, like the [Teal Organization](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations). It is a non-profit organization.
