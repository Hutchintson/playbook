title: Being a member
```

Being a member of Mangrove means :

### Always keeping in mind its purpose

Always keeping in mind the purpose of the organization is key. The only final boss of Mangrove's members is Mangrove's purpose, and all important decisions should be made under the light of this purpose. Members' work should converge towards it.


### Sharing its ideal

Members sharing a common strong culture is at the very root of Mangrove's existence. Before everything else, a member shares with Mangrove an ideal of what is a fulfilling professional life, and Mangrove's bets on how to achieve it - see [What is Mangrove](/welcome/what_is_mangrove).

### Adhering to its rules and habits, and helping improving them

A member can, and should, be critical of Mangrove's habits, but should globally adhere to them. Pairing and using the moodbot are examples of Mangrove's habits.


### Experimenting together

Mangrove is experimenting new modes of organization and governance. Its members should keep this in mind and keep an experimental mindset, learning from errors to refine the model.

### Being involved in the life and the construction of the ecosystem
