title: The Mangrove Foundations
```

Mangrove **relies on three foundations** to help its members grow :

- **Regular interactions**: sharing thoughts and having fun with Mangrove members on a daily or weekly basis creates an amazing foundation for personal enrichment. Thatâ€™s why we share offices, organize events and often go on retreats together!

- **Mutual help**: we have created several tools to directly help each other on our personal projects, whichever they are. It can range from giving a hand on a freelance gig to mentoring someone on their startup business.

- **Expansion to other like-minded people**: meeting and recruiting diverse people who share our values on a regular basis is key for our personal growth. It broadens our perspective and generates the most interesting projects & discussions within Mangrove.
