title: Residents Work
```

To keep growing together requires more than just planning retreats and events. It also requires to stay connected to members's desires and feelings about Mangrove, in order to draw a direction for the community that fulfills all of us. This important work is taken care of by a group of 10-15 particularly involved members, the Residents.

Residents give a direction to Mangrove by:

  - Gathering during Summits every 6 months to share their learnings and update Mangrove's vision and strategy.
  - Doing monthly calls (hubs, retraites, nouveaux)
  - Writing & Updating the Playbook [1]
  
Efforts within Mangrove has to go in a common direction. Residents coordinate them:

  - Retreats Planning Coordinators and Hub/Online Events Coordinators are residents 
  - Tech leadership (the tools & bots we use) is also ensured by residents
  
Having members in the community who deeply share the same values is also key for growing together. Residents are in charge of ensuring this by managing the memberships:

  - validate which new applicants can participate to a first retreat
  - validate Certainty periods of new members
  - Major Conflict resolutions & Membership Issues

And of course, some administration work is needed to make all this work:

  - **Finances and legal** aspects are managed by two residents. The people in charge change every year. They are coordinating financial decisions and communicating with the rest of the community the state of finance and legal.

***[1] Playbook evolutions:** Changes to the playbook must reflect a collective agreement that the residents have reached, online or during a collective intelligence work as done during a Summit. Changes can be made by any Resident ; all residents must be explicitely and quickly informed about it. If any resident has a veto on the changes, the playbook is rolled back to the previous version, with which everyone agreed.*
