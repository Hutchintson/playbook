### Residents

Residents have special rights and duties inside Mangrove. This goes on top of the responsibilities they take in a specific track.

Their responsibilities:

- Maintain tech
- Update Playbook 
- Major Conflict resolutions
- Transparency between tracks
- Administrative Tasks: legal and finance (see below)

Their rights:

- Do a talk / publicly represent Mangrove at events
- Invite someone with the Mangrove mindset at a retreat (becomes Slack guest on the retreat channel)
- Decide on who joins Mangrove (in collaboration with the Hunters)


**Finances and legal** aspects are managed by two residents. The people in charge change every year. They are coordinating financial decisions and communicating with the rest of the community the state of finance and legal. The goal is to not spend more money that we get.

**Playbook evolutions:** Changes to the playbook must reflect a collective agreement that the residents have reached, online or during a collective intelligence work as done during a Summit.

Changes can be made by any Resident ; all residents must be explicitely and quickly informed about it.

If any resident has a veto on the changes, the playbook is rolled back to the previous version, with which everyone agreed.
