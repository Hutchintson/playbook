A group of 10-15 particularly involved members are taking care of the following aspects of Mangrove :

- Giving a direction to Mangrove. They do this by:

  - Calls mensuels (hubs, retraites, nouveaux)
  - Ceux qui viennent aux summits
  - Writing & Updating Playbook [1]
  
- Coordinating main aspects of Mangrove:

  - Retreats Planning Coordinators and Hub/Online Events Coordinators are residents 
  - Tech leadership (the tools & bots we use) is also ensured by residents
  
- Memberships. They:

  - validate which new applicants can participate to a first retreat

  - **Finances and legal** aspects are managed by two residents. The people in charge change every year. They are coordinating financial decisions and communicating with the rest of the community the state of finance and legal.

**[1] Playbook evolutions:** Changes to the playbook must reflect a collective agreement that the residents have reached, online or during a collective intelligence work as done during a Summit.

Changes can be made by any Resident ; all residents must be explicitely and quickly informed about it.

If any resident has a veto on the changes, the playbook is rolled back to the previous version, with which everyone agreed.
