title: Building Mangrove
```

We all have a great time during retreats but also have to share all the practical tasks to run the retreat : groceries, cooking, cleaning. Itâ€™s the same in Mangrove : to enjoy all its advantages, we all need to put a collective effort to [build Mangrove (see the section below)](/building-mangrove/cooperation-culture/).

Building Mangrove can take many forms, all linked to one of [our three main goals](/welcome/foundations/). All members are part of a track specialized in one field (example: fostering local hub life) to make that happen.
