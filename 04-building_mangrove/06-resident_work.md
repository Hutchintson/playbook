title: Doing Residentâ€™s Work
```


### Residents

Residents have special rights and duties inside Mangrove. This goes on top of the responsibilities they take in a specific track.

Their responsibilities:

- Maintain tech
- Update Playbook 
- Major Conflict resolutions
- Transparency between tracks
- Administrative Tasks: legal and finance (see below)

Their rights:

- Do a talk / publicly represent Mangrove at events
- Invite someone with the Mangrove mindset at a retreat (becomes Slack guest on the retreat channel)
- Decide on who joins Mangrove (in collaboration with the Hunters)


**Finances and legal** aspects are managed by two residents. The people in charge change every year. They are coordinating financial decisions and communicating with the rest of the community the state of finance and legal. The goal is to not spend more money that we get.
In the long term, Mangrove hubs must become financially independent.
