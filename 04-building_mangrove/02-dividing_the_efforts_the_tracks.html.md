title: Dividing the efforts: The Tracks
```

On a more practical level, we divide the efforts to build Mangrove into tracks.

We have 5 tracks: [Catalysts](/building-mangrove/fostering-mutual-help), [Connectors](/building-mangrove/encouraging-daily-interactions), [Greeters](/building-mangrove/expanding-mangrove), [Hunters](/building-mangrove/expanding-mangrove) and [Retreat planners](/building-mangrove/encouraging-daily-interactions).

Every member has a main track. He/she can be “helper” on another track.
He/she has to be active in order to remain in that track: take part in discussions every week, ship valuable things regularly.

Each track has one coordinator. His/her role:

- Keep track of the overall activity of the track.
- Connect the different track members on projects.
- Identify when something is stuck and help coming up with next steps.
- Share updates of the track activity on Slack every 15 days. Longer debrief of track success and failures every 3 months.

The role of coordinator is not a special status. It’s better if it moves from one member to another during the year.

The track members decide on who can join their track (they can vote after 1 month of activity in the track). They have to be aware of the other tracks needs in order to avoid recruiting too many people if others are understaffed.
